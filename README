This repository contains code for the paper 'Sequential changepoint detection for label shift in classification', 
by Ciaran Evans and Max G'Sell. All code and data needed to reproduce the simulations and analysis are included. 

Results from Sections 3 and 4 are produced by the file simulation_analysis.R, which uses results stored in the 
folder simulation_output. The results in simulation_output were generated by files in the folder simulation_code. 
Comments in simulation_analysis.R explain which files generate which results.

Results from Section 5 (the case study on dengue data) are produced by dengue_analysis.R. The original dengue data 
used in our case study, from the paper by Tuan et al. (2015), is included in this repository as dengue_original.csv. 
Code for assessing detection performance with the dengue data is included in the folder dengue_code, with the results 
stored in the folder dengue_output.

If you have any questions, please contact Ciaran Evans (evansc@wfu.edu).
